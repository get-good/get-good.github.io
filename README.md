We are currently working on a project to give ICS students the opportunity to meet and work with other individuals taking the same classes. Our application will have the following features:

-Home page where users may setup/edit their profile, create an about page and view their current rating

-Profile page where students can signup for courses they're willing to provide help with and courses they're willing to receive help from.

-A reactive calendar where students can create/edit/remove study sessions with other users

## The App
If you're tired of bad grades, you're not the only one. Studybuddyfinder lets you find others who are struggling just as much as you are. Together, you can find people who are more knowledgeable on the topic and have them help you!

## Installation
This app requires meteor to be installed on your computer. To do so, please see their <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">page</a>.
To install studybuddyfinder, download the .zip file and extract all the files. Then, change your directory to the app directory contained in the extracted contents. From there, type meteor run and you're all set!
